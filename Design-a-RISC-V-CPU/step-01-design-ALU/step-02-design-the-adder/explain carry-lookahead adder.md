## "Carry-lookahead adder", what an intimidating name ! but it's really just about finding the general term based on the recursive formula for C[i]

---

A **carry-lookahead adder (CLA)** is a type of digital adder used in computer microarchitecture to perform fast binary addition. The main advantage of a CLA over a simple ripple-carry adder is its ability to reduce computation time by calculating carry bits in advance, based on the input addends.

To understand how a carry-lookahead adder works and to prove its correctness rigorously, let's delve into the fundamentals of binary addition and how carry bits are generated and propagated.

### Binary Addition Basics

In binary addition, each bit position adds two bits and a carry-in bit to produce a sum bit and a carry-out bit:

- **Sum bit**: \( S_i = A_i \oplus B_i \oplus C_{i-1} \)
- **Carry-out bit**: \( C_i = (A_i \cdot B_i) + (C_{i-1} \cdot (A_i \oplus B_i)) \)

Here:
- \( A_i \) and \( B_i \) are the bits being added at position \( i \).
- \( C_{i-1} \) is the carry-in from the previous position.
- \( \oplus \) denotes the XOR operation.
- \( \cdot \) denotes the AND operation.
- \( + \) denotes the OR operation.

In a ripple-carry adder, the carry-out \( C_i \) depends on \( C_{i-1} \), creating a sequential dependency that leads to longer computation times as the number of bits increases.

### Generate and Propagate Functions

To eliminate the sequential dependency of carries, we define two intermediate functions:

1. **Generate function (\( G_i \))**: Indicates whether a carry will be generated at bit position \( i \) regardless of the carry-in.
   \[
   G_i = A_i \cdot B_i
   \]

2. **Propagate function (\( P_i \))**: Indicates whether a carry-in at position \( i \) will propagate to a carry-out.
   \[
   P_i = A_i \oplus B_i
   \]

Using these functions, the carry-out can be expressed as:
\[
C_i = G_i + (P_i \cdot C_{i-1})
\]

### Carry-Lookahead Logic Derivation

The goal is to express each carry-out \( C_i \) in terms of the initial carry-in \( C_0 \) and the generate and propagate functions, without relying on the sequential calculation of previous carries.

Starting with \( C_1 \):
\[
C_1 = G_0 + (P_0 \cdot C_0)
\]

Similarly, for \( C_2 \):
\[
C_2 = G_1 + (P_1 \cdot C_1)
\]
Substitute \( C_1 \):
\[
C_2 = G_1 + (P_1 \cdot [G_0 + (P_0 \cdot C_0)])
\]
Simplify:
\[
C_2 = G_1 + (P_1 \cdot G_0) + (P_1 \cdot P_0 \cdot C_0)
\]

Continuing this process, we can generalize \( C_i \) as:
\[
C_i = G_{i-1} + (P_{i-1} \cdot G_{i-2}) + (P_{i-1} \cdot P_{i-2} \cdot G_{i-3}) + \dots + (P_{i-1} \cdot P_{i-2} \cdot \dots \cdot P_0 \cdot C_0)
\]

This equation shows that \( C_i \) depends on all the generate and propagate terms from the lower-order bits and the initial carry-in \( C_0 \).

### Proof of Correctness

**Inductive Proof**:

**Base Case** (\( i = 1 \)):
\[
C_1 = G_0 + (P_0 \cdot C_0)
\]
This matches our earlier definition and holds true.

**Inductive Step**:

Assume the formula holds for \( C_{i-1} \):
\[
C_{i-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{i-2} \left( \prod_{j=k+1}^{i-2} P_j \cdot G_k \right) + \left( \prod_{j=0}^{i-2} P_j \cdot C_0 \right)
\]

Then for \( C_i \):
\[
C_i = G_{i-1} + (P_{i-1} \cdot C_{i-1})
\]
Substitute \( C_{i-1} \):
\[
C_i = G_{i-1} + P_{i-1} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{i-2} \left( \prod_{j=k+1}^{i-2} P_j \cdot G_k \right) + \left( \prod_{j=0}^{i-2} P_j \cdot C_0 \right) \right)
\]
Simplify:
\[
C_i = G_{i-1} + \sum_{k=0}^{i-2} \left( \prod_{j=k+1}^{i-1} P_j \cdot G_k \right) + \left( \prod_{j=0}^{i-1} P_j \cdot C_0 \right)
\]
This matches the general formula for \( C_i \), confirming that the carry-lookahead logic correctly computes the carry-out bits.

### Computing the Sum Bits

Once all carry-out bits \( C_i \) are known, the sum bits \( S_i \) can be calculated independently:
\[
S_i = P_i \oplus C_{i-1}
\]
Since \( P_i = A_i \oplus B_i \), the sum depends only on the propagate function and the carry-in.

### Advantages of Carry-Lookahead Adders

- **Parallelism**: Carry bits are computed using logic that depends only on the input bits, allowing for parallel computation.
- **Speed**: Reduces the propagation delay from \( O(n) \) in ripple-carry adders to \( O(\log n) \) in carry-lookahead adders, where \( n \) is the number of bits.
- **Scalability**: More efficient for large bit-width additions due to reduced delay.

### Conclusion

The carry-lookahead adder improves upon the ripple-carry adder by eliminating the sequential dependency of carry bits. By using generate and propagate functions, it calculates carry-out bits in advance using logical expressions that depend only on the input bits. This approach significantly enhances computation speed, especially in adders with a large number of bits.
